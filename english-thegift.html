                <p>In the poem "The Gift in Wartime" by Tran Mong Tu, the speaker is addressing a person who is far away, possibly in a war zone. The person cannot hear or understand the speaker because they are separated by distance and the noise of the war.</p>

                <h4>b. Write an essay on the effects of war</h4>
                <p>War has a profound and lasting effect on people and communities. The physical and emotional toll of war is devastating, and many people never fully recover from its effects. War can cause physical injury and death, as well as emotional trauma and psychological damage. It can also lead to loss of property, displacement, and economic hardship. In addition, war can tear apart families and communities, leaving individuals feeling isolated and alone.</p>
                <p>The impact of war is not limited to those who are directly involved. War can have a ripple effect, affecting generations to come. Children who grow up in war-torn countries often experience trauma, poverty, and a lack of access to education and healthcare. They may also be forced to participate in the conflict, which can have lifelong consequences.</p>
                <p>In addition to the physical and emotional toll of war, it can also have a devastating impact on the environment. War can lead to the destruction of natural habitats and wildlife, as well as the pollution of air, water, and soil. This can have long-lasting consequences for the health of individuals and ecosystems.</p>
                <p>Overall, the effects of war are far-reaching and deeply damaging. It is important for individuals, communities, and nations to work towards peace and find alternative solutions to conflicts in order to minimize the impact of war on people and the planet.</p>
