            <div class="summary">
                <p>Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple Inc., gave a famous graduation speech at Stanford University in 2005, where he talked about the idea of "how to live before you die." In this speech, Jobs shared his experiences, lessons, and reflections on life, death, and finding purpose.</p>
                <p>Jobs talked about how he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, which made him reflect on his life and what he wanted to do with the limited time he had left. He realized that life is short and that we should not waste time living someone else's life, but rather create our own unique paths and experiences.</p>
                <p>He encouraged the audience to follow their passions and to not settle for a mundane existence, saying that "the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do." Jobs encouraged the graduates to take risks, to be bold, and to chase their dreams, even if it means making mistakes and facing challenges along the way.</p>
                <p>Jobs also spoke about the importance of connecting with others and finding love, as well as the significance of death and how it can give our lives meaning and purpose. He stated that death is a part of life and that it should not be feared, but embraced as a reminder to make the most of each day.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, Steve Jobs' speech was a powerful reminder that life is short and that we should make the most of it by pursuing our passions, connecting with others, and embracing death as a way to live a more meaningful life. He encouraged the audience to live before they die, to create their own stories, and to make a positive impact on the world.</p>
