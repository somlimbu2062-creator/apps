                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>The story of "The Selfish Giant" revolves around a giant who resided in a magnificent castle, boasting a vast and beautiful garden with lush green grass and vibrant flowers. The local children habitually played in this garden every afternoon. However, upon the giant's return from a seven-year visit to his friend, the Cornish ogre, he became enraged to discover the children playing there. Consumed by selfishness, he constructed a towering wall around his garden and erected a sign proclaiming, "Trespassers will be prosecuted."</p>
                    <p>The giant's actions left the children with no place to play, leading to their profound sadness. Consequently, the garden also suffered due to the giant's selfishness. While spring bloomed universally across the country, the garden remained trapped in winter, devoid of singing birds and blossoming trees. Snow, Frost, the North Wind, and Hail took permanent residence, rendering the garden even colder and more unwelcoming.</p>
                    <p>One morning, the giant awoke to the joyful sound of a bird singing outside his window. He leaped out of bed to find that the children had managed to slip back into the garden. They were playing amidst the trees, which had miraculously sprung back to life, adorned with blossoms and gently swaying their branches above the children's heads. The flowers laughed, the birds tweeted, and everything was once again vibrant and cheerful, except for one corner of the garden that still clung to winter.</p>
                    <p>In that solitary corner, a small boy wept, unable to reach the branches of the tree he yearned to play in. The giant approached the boy, gently lifted him, and placed him into the tree. Instantly, the tree blossomed, and the boy ceased crying. The giant realized the error of his selfish ways, understanding that true happiness stems from sharing and kindness. From that day forward, the garden perpetually remained in spring, and the giant transformed into a benevolent and welcoming host for all children who wished to play there.</p>

                <div class="question-block">
                    <strong>a. Where did the children use to play?</strong>
                    <p>The children used to play in the <strong>giant's garden</strong> before it became a desolate place.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="question-block">
                    <strong>b. What did the Snow and the Frost do to the garden?</strong>
                    <p>In the story "The Selfish Giant", <strong>Snow and Frost</strong> wreaked havoc in the giant's garden. They covered the entire garden with ice and snow, causing the flowers and trees to wither and die. The garden became a barren and lifeless wasteland as a result of the Snow and Frost's actions.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="question-block">
                    <strong>c. What did the giant hear when he was lying awake in bed?</strong>

                <div class="question-block">
                    <strong>d. Why do you think spring season never came to the giant's garden?</strong>
                    <p>The spring season never came to the giant's garden because the giant was <strong>selfish and unkind</strong>. He refused to let the children play in his garden and was always looking for something to take away from them. He was so focused on hoarding his possessions that he failed to see the beauty of the world around him and never felt the warmth of the sun. This caused his garden to be cold, dark, and dreary, and spring never came to it.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="question-block">
                    <strong>e. How did the giant realise his mistake?</strong>
                    <p>In the story of "The Selfish Giant," the giant realizes his mistake when he sees the <strong>children playing in his garden and notices how joyous and happy they are</strong>. He realizes that he has been depriving them of this happiness and understands that his selfishness has caused the spring season to never come to his garden. The giant finally comprehends that love, kindness, and generosity bring joy and happiness and decides to open his garden to the children forever.</p>

                <h2>A. Read the extracts given below and answer the questions that follow.</h2>

                <div class="question-block">
                    <strong>a. “How happy we were there!” they said to each other.</strong>
                    <p>i. Where does ‘there’ refer to?</p>
                    <p>ii. What does ‘they’ refer to?</p>
                    <p>iii. Why are they saying so?</p>
                    <p>Answer:</p>
                    <p>i. "There" refers to the place where "they" were, specifically the <strong>Giant's garden before he built the wall</strong>.</p>
                    <p>ii. "They" refers to the <strong>children</strong> who used to play in the garden.</p>
                    <p>iii. They are saying so because they fondly remember the <strong>joy and freedom they experienced while playing in the Giant's beautiful garden</strong> before he shut them out.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="question-block">
                    <strong>b. “I have many beautiful flowers,” he said; “but the children are the most beautiful flowers of all.”</strong>
                    <p>i. Who is the speaker?</p>
                    <p>ii. Who is he speaking to?</p>
                    <p>iii. Who are ‘the children’ that the speaker is referring to?</p>
                    <p>iv. Why is the speaker saying that ‘the children are the most beautiful flowers of all’?</p>
                    <p>Answer:</p>
                    <p>i. The speaker is the <strong>Giant</strong>.</p>
                    <p>ii. He is speaking to <strong>himself, reflecting on his realization</strong>.</p>
                    <p>iii. The children that the speaker is referring to are the <strong>children who had returned to play in his garden</strong>.</p>
                    <p>iv. The speaker is saying that the children are the most beautiful flowers of all because he now understands that the <strong>joy, life, and warmth the children bring are far more valuable and beautiful than any mere flowers in his garden</strong>.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="question-block">
                    <strong>c. When the little child smiled at the Giant, and said to him, "You let me play once in your garden, today you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise," shortly afterwards, the happy giant dies. What is the coincidence of this event? Describe it in relation to this fairy tale.</strong>
                    <p>The coincidence of this event is that the giant dies shortly after the little child spoke to him and invited him to Paradise. This is related to the fairy tale because the <strong>child represents innocence, kindness, and ultimately, a divine or heavenly connection</strong>. The giant's death, immediately following this invitation, symbolizes the <strong>power of love and kindness to transform even the hardest of hearts, leading to redemption and a peaceful passage to a spiritual 'Paradise'</strong>. It suggests that his act of selfless love for the child earned him this ultimate reward.</p>
