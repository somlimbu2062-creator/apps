                        This statement is not true. Money can give us the power to make a difference in the lives of others, but not the desire to do so. It can give us the time to develop and nurture our relationships, but not the love and caring necessary to do so. It can just as easily make us jaded, escapist, selfish, and lonely. How much do you need? What is it going to cost you to get it? It is keeping these two questions in mind that gives us a true sense of money’s relationship to happiness. If we have less than what we need, or if what we have is costing us too much, we can never be happy.

                        <p><strong>ii. Intellectual resources help survival of the mankind.</strong></p>
                        This statement is true. It is because of the intellectual resources that we have combated many diseases. Though man is not the fittest among all the creations of God, he is able to ensure his safety against the other powerful creatures of nature because of his intellectual resources. Basic research can help our survival by giving us new sources of energy and new mineral deposits. Basic research can also protect us against terrorism.

Scientists keep on studying the ecological changes and forewarn people about natural disasters like earthquakes, tsunamis, storms etc. People can be evacuated from the area posed with danger.

As a seismologist, he had theoretical knowledge in seismic waves that could easily detect underground nuclear explosions as well as tremors produced by earthquakes. His knowledge could easily detect secret underground nuclear test. Here, his knowledge had a direct application in the survival of the humankind. According to him, science is the indispensable guardian and caretaker of humankind’s survival. Scientific researchers have found the solutions to the problems of human beings. It has given us new sources of energy, new mineral deposits, medicines and efficient defense from terrorism.

                        The writer’s stand here in this essay is that scientists are the most practical people in the world. According to him, all new technologies and new brands of industry from defense to entertainment are the result of scientists’ research. The scientists invent antibiotics, electronics, biotechnology, synthetic fibers, modes of transport, the green revolution, and genetic forensic diagnosis etc. Only the scientific research can provide us new sources of energy and new minerals, efficient defense from terrorism, cure from cancer and new forms of transportation. By this we can say that scientists are the most practical people in the world.

                    <div class="answer">
                        Nuclear weapons are the most terrifying weapon ever invented: no weapon is more destructive; no weapon causes such unspeakable human suffering; and there is no way to control how far the radioactive fallout will spread or how long the effects will last.
                        <br><br>
                        Although the superpowers have already reached an agreement to stop nuclear test, the growing competition for power has increased fear and uncertainty about our future. It is a truth that Soviet Union, the United States and the United Kingdom have more than enough nuclear bombs to destroy the other nations in their first strike. A nuclear bomb detonated in a city would immediately kill tens of thousands of people, and tens of thousands more would suffer horrific injuries and later die from radiation exposure. Hiroshima and Nagasaki always remind people of the bitter truth. Anytime, the global politics can deteriorate and crazy rulers like that of North Korea can forget humanity and the world population can suffer. Therefore, every man, woman, and child on the earth is living under the threat of annihilation by nuclear weapons.

                        According to the essayist, science is our indispensable guardian and caretaker because it is the only science that can ensure that we are moving with time safely. For the survival of humankind, countries have signed the treaty of not testing nuclear weapons secretly. Specialists can invigilate the moves of different countries and make us alert on time. Science can differentiate between the tremors caused by nuclear explosions and natural earthquakes. It gives us new sources of energy, new mineral deposits, efficient defense from terrorism, antibiotics and cure for human diseases. Besides that, science teaches us how to preserve our ecosystem and biosphere correcting our past mistakes. At present, the safety of mankind is threatened by both natural and man-made disasters. Be it a tsunami, be it terrorism, money alone cannot tackle the problem. Scientific solutions are the only hope. Therefore, while there is science, there is hope of survival and wellbeing for all of us.

                        <p><strong>Science – A Blessing or A Curse</strong></p>
                        Science has benefited man in several ways. It has made man’s life more comfortable, more secure and more powerful. But it is not an unmixed blessing. There are several disadvantages of science. However, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages.

The room is flooded with light, the fan begins to whirr and give refreshing air, or still more, a desert cooler or an air conditioner turns the room into a hill resort. Thousand types of machines are run by electricity. Room heaters, electric ovens and cooking ranges and several other household appliances are operated by electricity. It runs factories which produce innumerable things of our daily use.

                        In the light of all these grave dangers, it is imperative that man tries to make judicious use of machines. After all, man had applied his mind to invent new things not to make his life miserable, but to make it more comfortable and better. Machines should serve mankind. Man should ensure that he does not allow them to destroy his environment and health and put the life of all living things in grave danger beyond a point of no return.
