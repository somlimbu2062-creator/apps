            <h3>Questions and Answers</h3>
            <div class="question-answer">
                <h4>a. Why did Jonathan think of himself as 'extraordinarily lucky'?</h4>
                <p>Jonathan thinks of himself as 'extraordinarily lucky' because he has managed to survive the Nigerian Civil War with his family intact and his house still standing. Despite the chaos and destruction of the war, he has managed to keep his job as a motorcycle taxi driver and has even been able to buy a bicycle, which he sees as a symbol of his good fortune. Throughout the story, Jonathan is grateful for the "five blessings" in his life: his family, his house, his job, his bicycle, and his peace of mind. This positive outlook and gratitude help him to see the good in his life, even in the midst of difficult circumstances.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question-answer">
                <h4>b. What are the ‘five blessings’ for which Jonathan is grateful?</h4>
                <p>In the short story "Civil Peace" by Chinua Achebe, the protagonist, Jonathan, considers himself to be "extraordinarily lucky" because he has survived the Nigerian Civil War and has "five blessings." The five blessings are: His wife Maria is still alive, his children are all alive, he has a bicycle, he has a job as a teacher and is earning money, and he still has his house, although it is partially destroyed. Jonathan is grateful for these things because during the war, many people lost their lives and their homes, so the fact that he has survived and still has these blessings is a source of gratitude for him.</p>

            <div class="question-answer">
                <h4>c. Why did Jonathan mistrust the officer who wanted to take his bicycle? What does this tell you about the situation in Nigeria?</h4>
                <p>Jonathan mistrusts the officer who wants to take his bicycle because the situation in Nigeria was chaotic and uncertain in the aftermath of the civil war. The country was in disarray and there was a lack of security, with many people taking advantage of the chaos to enrich themselves. Jonathan is afraid that the officer might be one of these opportunists who are trying to take advantage of the situation, and so he mistrusts him and is wary of giving him his bicycle. This mistrust of the authorities and the general uncertainty in the country highlights the instability and lack of security in Nigeria during this time.</p>

            <div class="question-answer">
                <h4>d. What visitors might be at the door? Are Jonathan and his wife completely surprised? Explain.</h4>
                <p>In "Civil Peace" by Chinua Achebe, the visitors at the door are likely to be thieves, but it is not specified. Jonathan and his wife are not completely surprised when they hear the pounding on the door because they are aware of the unrest and lawlessness that is prevalent in Nigeria following the civil war. However, they still feel nervous and uncertain about who the visitors might be and what they want. This tension and fear reflects the unstable and insecure state of the country after the war, as well as the widespread distrust of people in positions of authority.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question-answer">
                <h4>e. Why does no one in the neighbourhood respond when the thieves pound on Jonathan’s door? Why do the thieves call for the police?</h4>
                <p>In the story "Civil Peace" by Chinua Achebe, the reason why no one in the neighborhood responds when the thieves pound on Jonathan's door is because they are afraid to get involved. The situation in Nigeria after the civil war is still unstable and people are wary of getting involved in any kind of trouble. They prefer to keep a low profile and stay out of trouble. This is why the thieves call for the police. The situation in Nigeria is still uncertain and people are scared of getting into trouble, so they avoid getting involved in any situation that might bring them to the attention of the authorities.</p>

                <h4>d. Nigerian English has words like soja 'soldier' and katakata 'confusion', 'trouble' derived apparently from English words but transformed by native languages' phonologies. What does the author’s use of dialect here add to the story?</h4>
                <p>The author's use of dialect adds authenticity and cultural context to the story. By using words like <i>soja</i> and <i>katakata</i>, the author is able to create a sense of place and give the reader a glimpse into the unique linguistic and cultural landscape of Nigeria. The use of dialect also serves to humanize the characters and make them more relatable, as it allows the reader to connect with the story on a deeper level. By incorporating elements of Nigerian English, the author is able to create a rich and immersive storytelling experience that transports the reader to a different world.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question-answer">
                <h4>e. Why do you think the thieves who come to rob Jonathan speak English with a heavier African accent than Jonathan does?</h4>
                <p>The thieves who come to rob Jonathan may speak English with a heavier African accent than Jonathan does because they come from a different background and may not have had the same level of education or exposure to Standard English. This difference in accents highlights the social and economic divide between Jonathan and the thieves, as Jonathan is depicted as being better educated and more affluent. Additionally, the use of a heavy African accent also serves to distinguish the thieves from Jonathan and create a sense of tension and conflict between the two characters.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question-answer">
                <h4>f. The title of the story "Civil Peace" itself is ironical as there is little to differentiate ‘civil peace’ from ‘civil war’. Do you think that the title of this story is appropriate, or would “Civil War” have been a better title? Explain.</h4>
                <p>The title "Civil Peace" is appropriate as it reflects the irony in the situation. The concept of civil peace in the aftermath of a civil war is meant to bring stability, security, and peace to the citizens, but the reality is often different. In the story, Jonathan experiences many challenges despite the supposed civil peace, including having his bicycle taken away by an officer and being visited by thieves. The use of the word "peace" highlights the contrast between what is promised and what is actually experienced by the characters, making it an effective and appropriate title.</p>
                <p>However, an argument could be made for "Civil War" as an alternative title, as the events in the story highlight the ongoing struggles and challenges that exist even after the official end of a conflict. The choice of title ultimately depends on the perspective of the reader and the purpose of the story.</p>
