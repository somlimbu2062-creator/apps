            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <div class="summary">
                <p>"An Astrologer's Day" is a short story written by R.K. Narayan. It takes place in India and follows the story of an astrologer who travels from village to village offering his services to those who seek to know their fortunes. The astrologer is not well-regarded, and people often question his abilities. However, he is a skilled con-man, who uses his knowledge of human nature and his cunning wit to fool people into thinking he has supernatural powers.</p>
                <p>One day, a man comes to the astrologer seeking answers about his missing brother. The astrologer uses his knowledge of the man's past to fabricate a story about the missing brother and manages to convince the man that his brother is still alive. The man is overjoyed, and the astrologer feels a sense of pride in his ability to bring happiness to others.</p>
                <p>However, the astrologer's sense of pride is short-lived. Later in the day, the man who had come to him earlier returns with the news that his brother has been found dead. The astrologer is shattered, as he realizes that he has unintentionally brought false hope to the man, who was already grieving the loss of his brother.</p>
                <p>The astrologer reflects on his own mortality, and the fact that his profession of astrology is nothing but a sham. He feels a deep sense of emptiness and realizes that he has been living a lie all his life. The story ends with the astrologer contemplating the ultimate purpose of his life, and questioning the value of his existence.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, "An Astrologer's Day" is a thought-provoking story that explores the themes of truth, deceit, and the search for meaning in life. The story offers a powerful commentary on the power of the human mind and the dangers of living a life based on lies. Through its powerful narrative and insightful commentary, the story challenges us to examine our own beliefs, and the things we hold dear in life.</p>

                <h4>a. How does the astrologer’s appearance help him attract customers? How does he help the customers satisfy their needs?</h4>
                <p>The astrologer's appearance is unkempt and shabby, but he has a wise and kind look in his eyes that helps him attract customers. He helps customers by listening to their problems, interpreting their horoscopes, and providing them with advice and guidance that satisfies their emotional and psychological needs. He also provides them with a sense of comfort and hope, which helps them feel better about their situations.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question-answer">
                <h4>b. How do you characterise the astrologer’s attitude toward the stranger?</h4>
                <p>In the story "An Astrologer's Day," the astrologer is initially depicted as being wary and suspicious of the stranger who approaches him. This is seen when the astrologer assesses the stranger's appearance and behavior, and then gives him vague and misleading answers to his initial questions. However, as the story progresses, the astrologer's attitude toward the stranger changes, and he becomes more open and friendly. He even goes so far as to offer the stranger detailed information about his past and future, seemingly in an attempt to gain his trust and win his business. Overall, the astrologer's attitude toward the stranger can be characterized as manipulative and opportunistic, with a clear desire to exploit his customer for financial gain.</p>

                <h4>c. What details does the astrologer give the stranger about his past?</h4>
                <p>In "An Astrologer's Day" by R.K. Narayan, the astrologer gives the stranger very vague and limited details about his past. When the stranger first comes to him, the astrologer seems to be more interested in making money than helping the stranger. The astrologer tells the stranger that he was born in a poor family, has suffered many hardships, and has learned astrology as a means of supporting himself. However, the astrologer's description of his own past is not particularly detailed or specific, and it's unclear how much of it is true and how much is simply a performance designed to gain the stranger's trust.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question-answer">
                <h4>d. Why does he advise the stranger to go home immediately?</h4>
                <p>The astrologer advises the stranger to go home immediately because he believes that the stranger is in danger. According to the astrologer's astrological calculations, the stranger is going through a dangerous period in his life and it is best for him to return home as soon as possible. The astrologer's advice is based on the belief that astrology can predict the future and influence events. By giving this advice, the astrologer believes he is helping to protect the stranger from any potential harm that may come his way.</p>

            <div class="question-answer">
                <h4>e. What is your reaction to the conversation between the astrologer and his wife?</h4>
                <p>The conversation between the astrologer and his wife can be interpreted in different ways by different readers. Some readers may view the conversation as humorous, while others may find it sad or revealing of the astrologer's relationship with his wife. The astrologer's wife is portrayed as a practical, no-nonsense woman who is aware of her husband's trickery and is not afraid to call him out on it. In the conversation, she shows her frustration with her husband's lies and his repeated promise to quit his job as an astrologer. The conversation may be seen as a commentary on the complex dynamics of relationships and the toll that dishonesty can take on them.</p>

The stranger's insistence on hearing what the astrologer has to say, despite his initial skepticism, adds to the sense of anticipation.

                <p>The author uses several details and techniques to describe the astrologer. The astrologer is described as being thin and emaciated with a face that is wrinkled with age. He is dressed in a tattered, brown cloth and carries a bag filled with astrological charts and other equipment. The author also uses the astrologer's mannerisms and speech patterns to further illustrate his character.</p>

                <p>The astrologer's manner of dress, which is described as tattered and worn, suits his character because it reflects his status as a poor, itinerant fortune-teller. The astrologer's ragged appearance also helps him to gain the sympathy and trust of his customers, as they are more likely to believe that he is a genuine seer if he appears to be in need of their help.</p>
