            <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
            <div class="question-answer">
                <h4>a. The professional addressed as ‚Äòyou‚Äô in the sentence ‚ÄúIf you are clever, why are you so poor?‚Äù refers to a‚Ä¶</h4>
                <p>The correct option is **iii. scientist**. The "you" in this case refers to a scientist. The author wonders why some intelligent individuals choose to pursue careers in science while other occupations, such as those of attorneys, surgeons, and businesspeople, pay far higher salaries. The author wants to demonstrate that even if scientists are extremely intelligent, wealth creation is not always facilitated by their intelligence. As a result, scientists are typically intelligent yet underprivileged.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question-answer">
                <h4>b. The writer says, ‚ÄúI found myself in Geneva.‚Äù What does it express?</h4>
                <p>It expresses the **surprise of the writer**. He says the above line because he was summoned all of a sudden to attend the meeting related to nuclear weapons in Geneva.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="question-answer">
                <h4>c. Are the following statements true? Why or why not? Discuss with your partner.</h4>
                <p><b>i. Money is more powerful than intellectual resources.</b></p>
                <p>This statement is **not true**. Money can give us the power to make a difference in the lives of others, but not the desire to do so. It can give us the time to develop and nurture our relationships, but not the love and caring necessary to do so. It can just as easily make us jaded, escapist, selfish, and lonely. How much do you need? What is it going to cost you to get it? It is keeping these two questions in mind that gives us a true sense of money‚Äôs relationship to happiness. If we have less than what we need, or if what we have is costing us too much, we can never be happy.</p>
                <p><b>ii. Intellectual resources help survival of the mankind.</b></p>
                <p>This assertion is **accurate**. We have fought numerous illnesses because of the intellectual resources. Despite not being the most physically fit of all God's creatures, man is able to protect himself from other strong natural enemies thanks to his cerebral capabilities.

                <h4>c. Is science a blessing or a curse? Write an essay on it</h4>
                <p>Science has been a subject of much debate and discussion for centuries, with opinions divided as to whether it is a blessing or a curse. On the one hand, science has brought about numerous advancements and improvements in our lives, from medical breakthroughs to technological innovations. These advancements have improved our quality of life, increased our life expectancy, and allowed us to live in a more interconnected world. However, science has also had its dark side, leading to the development of weapons of mass destruction and environmental degradation. The atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II, for example, resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives and the widespread destruction of entire cities. Similarly, the overuse of natural resources and the release of harmful chemicals into the environment have led to significant environmental degradation and the loss of biodiversity. Furthermore, science has also been used to justify unethical practices and experiments, such as human experimentation, genetic modification, and animal testing. These practices have led to significant ethical and moral dilemmas, and have caused widespread public concern. In conclusion, whether science is a blessing or a curse depends on how it is used. On the one hand, it has brought about numerous positive advancements that have improved our lives in countless ways. On the other hand, it has also been used to cause significant harm, both to individuals and to the environment. Ultimately, it is up to us to ensure that science is used for the greater good, and that its negative consequences are minimized. By using science in a responsible and ethical manner, we can ensure that it remains a blessing for future generations.</p>
